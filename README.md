# Movies Board SBA #1

-This project is about a Movie Board. 
The Movie board is a website that has movies and their descriptions populated on the homepage. They will allow
users to be able to read a little synopsis of the movie to help them decide if they want to watch the movie or not.
Users will also be able to log in (for a future feature: and add movies to their watchlist). Users will also be able
to add in movie recommendations from the Add Movies page as well. 
<br>
  This Movie Board has 3 webpages that have CSS, HTML and Javascript completed. Some specs include:
  using HTML 5, Javascript (functions, for loop, arrays, conditional statements, etc), and CSS
  with outside images, multiple different html tag, web fonts, drop down menu, regex validation in the log in page,
  inline external and internal CSS, etc.
  On the homepage, you will see a list of movies and their descriptions posted under their images. 
  At the navbar, you will see a button for "Home" and a Button that says "Links".
  Upon hovering on the "Links" button, you will be able to select a Log in Page or an Add Movies page.
  The Log in in the future, will allow you to save Movies you'd like to watch.
  The Add Movies page will allow you to add Movie recommendations to be posted on the home page in the future.
  Both the login page and the add movies page uses Forms to complete this.
